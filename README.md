# Batch-file-maker-py-files
Allows user to create a batch file by specifying the location of their python.exe path, and the path of the .py file they want to include. Paths are inputted via file browser. When making the file it requests a name and location for the user wants the file. On repeated use of the program it will autofill the location of the latest exe path.

# Misc
The reason I made this was because of my latest program, the App time tracker, I wanted it to be always running on my computer so I turned it into a batch file and had it launch on startup. I realized while making the file that I didnt want to spend the 2-3 minutes each time making the file so I quickly made this to do it for me.
